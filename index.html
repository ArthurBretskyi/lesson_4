      <h2 class="history-title" id="history">History</h2>
      <div class="history-block">
        <p class="history-text">
          In 1975, Hisatake Shibuya opened a shop called Electric Sound Products
          (ESP) in Tokyo, Japan, which provided custom replacement parts for
          guitars. At this time, ESP also began making guitars under the ESP and
          Navigator brand in the Japanese market.
        </p>
        <p class="history-text">
          ESP replacement parts were first introduced into the US in 1983 and
          began crafting custom instruments for local New York artists between
          1984 and 1985. Among these artists were Page Hamilton (Helmet), Vernon
          Reid (Living Colour), Vinnie Vincent and Bruce Kulick (KISS), Sid
          McGinnis of Late Night with David Letterman and Ronnie Wood (The
          Rolling Stones). At this time, ESP also introduced the 400 Series as
          the first production line to be distributed in the US.
        </p>
        <p class="history-text">
          During this same period, ESP began making the bodies and necks for
          Kramer Guitars and other manufacturers were using ESP as an OEM such
          as Robin Guitars, Schecter Guitar Research and DiMarzio. Many traits
          of the Kramer line are still visible including neck construction and
          body bevels. ESP tooled up for Tom Anderson's shaved bolt on neck heel
          on the Schecter bodies and this has since become a feature of their
          house brand.
        </p>
        <p class="history-text">
          In 1985, George Lynch discovered ESP while on tour in Tokyo. Lynch
          walked into an ESP shop looking for a replacement neck and learned
          that ESP also built custom guitars. As a result, his famous ESP
          Kamikaze was made and ESP released George Lynch's Kamikaze as its
          first signature model. ESP soon introduced the M1 Standard, MI Custom,
          Horizon Custom, and the Surveyor bass.
        </p>
        <p class="history-text">
          At this time, ESP based its headquarters in a loft in downtown New
          York City on 19th Street. In 1989, the headquarters were moved to 48th
          Street near other music stores.
        </p>
        <p class="history-text">
          Between 1990 and 1992, ESP expanded its Signature Series as well as
          its standard product line. The US replacement parts business was
          discontinued in order to focus solely on their guitar and bass line,
          as well as the Custom Shop series.[citation needed] There are about 41
          signature series guitars. In 1993, ESP moved its headquarters again
          but this time to Los Angeles, on Sunset Blvd. in Hollywood. In 1995,
          the LTD series was created to produce ESP's high-quality products at a
          more affordable price. Soon after the introduction of the Korean and
          Indonesian-made LTD lines, ESP stopped selling the majority of its
          Japanese-made flagship guitars in the United States, due to the high
          prices involved in exporting to the Americas. The lone exception was
          ESP's artist signature series, which remained ESP (rather than LTD)
          models. In the early 2000s (decade), ESP resumed exporting the
          standard Japanese-made lines to the United States (where they are
          popular among heavy metal and hard rock players), though at greatly
          increased prices compared to the early 1990s.

        Manufacturing operations
      </h2>
      <div class="manufacturing-block">
        <p class="manufacturing-text">
          Original series and Custom Shop ESPs are handcrafted in Japan while
          the Standard Series ESPs are factory-made in Japan.
        </p>
        <p class="manufacturing-text">
          In 1996, ESP started its "LTD" series. These guitars are similar to
          lower-end ESP guitars, but are more affordable and cater mainly for
          markets outside Japan. The 1000 series LTDs are made on an assembly
          line in Korea whereas the 401 series and below are made in Indonesia.
        </p>
        <p class="manufacturing-text">
          LTD basses are instruments mainly aimed at beginners. Over the years
          manufacturing has moved between various locations, including Vietnam,
          China and Indonesia. Intermediate models were manufactured in Korea in
          the early 2000s (decade). The quality from these has led to continued
          demand for the LTD series.
        </p>
        <p class="manufacturing-text">
          Additionally, ESP has two separate Japan-only lines of guitars, the
          Grassroots (lower end) and Edwards (Mid-range). The Grassroots line is
          manufactured in Korea and are the equivalent or better than the
          Sub-400 series LTDs and can be considered a budget line. The Edwards
          guitars, on the other hand, are made in Japan and boast similar
          hardware as their higher-end ESP counterparts but are not handcrafted.
          In terms of quality, in contrast to the USA lines (i.e. ESP Standard &
          LTD), the Edwards line generally lies in between the more upmarket
          LTDs and ESP Standards.
        </p>
        <p class="manufacturing-text">
          ESP guitars cater to a wide range of players. There are a variety of
          models including Superstrat-styled guitars, Les Paul-styled guitars,
          Flying V-styled, Star-shaped and others. ESP technically has two
          lines, one for USA and Japan, but there are slight differences. The
          ESP USA line doesn't include the Strat-like Snapper, the Forest GT, as
          well as some of the Japanese rock artist models but their custom line
          has been known to produce some of the most unusual designs such as a
          Gundam Beam-rifle replica guitar, as well as the "ESP Machinegun" used
          by the Japanese band Alfee.
        </p>
        <p class="manufacturing-text">
          ESP not only make guitars, they also produce various hardware parts
          themselves, like bass bridges or the ESP Flicker tremolo, ESP Labs
          Pickups, as well as sustainers, equalizers, etc. Usually these parts
          are only available for OEM use and not to the ordinary customer.

      <div class="popularity-block">
        <p class="popularity-text">
          ESP found fame by making and endorsing guitars for guitarists who went
          on to become leading exponents of thrash metal in the 1980s, along
          with other guitar manufacturers Jackson and Dean, with bands
          Metallica, Slayer, Anthrax and Megadeth. As a result of these
          endorsements, ESP has become one of the most popular suppliers of
          guitars for heavy metal. ESP instruments are endorsed by musicians
          numbering in the hundreds. A complete list of them can be found on the
          Artists section of ESP Guitars' website.
        </p>
        <p class="popularity-text">
          The bass signatures by J, founder of Luna Sea, are one of the most
          influential models manufactured by ESP, with over 50,000 copies
          sold.[4] From the same band, Sugizo also contributed significantly to
          the brand with his design ideas.

      <h2 class="guitars-title" id="guitars">Guitars and bass series</h2>
      <div class="guitars-block">
        <p class="guitars-text">
          Dependent on the target market (i.e. Asia, US, Europe) and brand (ESP,
          LTD or Xtone), various models are organized in marketing series.
        </p>
        <p class="guitars-text">
          The ESP Original series has three other lines of guitars, the Edwards,
          Grassroots and Navigator series and are largely based on these models
          as well as some ESP Standard series Models. ESP Edwards Series
          produces mid-to-high range guitars, at a quality near the ESP Standard
          series, whilst ESP Grass Roots Series cater towards a more
          value-oriented segment of the market and are more akin to the 400
          series of LTDs, however these can vary. The ESP Navigator Series on
          the other hand is a line which produces mainly replicas of Gibson and
          Fender guitars and basses, to a very high standard.
        </p>
        <p class="guitars-text">
          ESP USA features the ESP Standard line (which was replaced in 2014 by
          E-II), as well as the lower end LTD and Xtone series. ESP USA's
          standard series generally caters more towards to metal players, with
          characteristics such as active pickups.
        </p>
        <p class="guitars-text">
          Another line of guitars, called LTD Elite, was introduced in 2013 for
          overseas markets, as the ESP Standard line was slowly being phased
          out. LTD Elite guitars are made in Japan, and initially offered
          alongside the ESP standard replacement brand E-II in the export market
          in 2013 while a limited range of ESP Standards were sold in the US to
          be phased out for E-II in 2014. The ESP Standard line had been
          completely discontinued by this time. E-II guitars initially resembled
          several Edwards designs, however in 2015 many new models and finishes
          not available to Edwards were released. In 2016, E-II receives many
          new and first-time models, including Eclipse guitars with a sculpted
          neck joint similar to Gibson's Axcess heel to improve playability.
          According to ESP, E-II is the direct successor to ESP Standard with no
          difference between the two except the name.
